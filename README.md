# ActivityTracker
    This app is designed to track some sort of activity - how far you are through completing some sort of task,
    such as learning a foreign language, practicing yoga, or stitching a quilt, so the data falls into two types: 
    1. A specific item of data we are working on. For example, if our activity was travelling this might be
    one specific sight we'd like to visit, or if we were tracking a book reading habit then this might be one 
    specific book we want to read.
    2. If we put lots of items together, we get a project. For travelling this might be a trip such as 
    "Visit Asia", or for books it might be "Books by Agatha Christie".
